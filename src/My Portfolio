<h1> i’m a Full-Stack Developer based in West London. I am passionate about functional programming, learning new languages and improving my proficiency. 
My passion for technology led me to launch my tech career in 2017 working very long hours for a start-up in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK in a Business Development role. Daily, I convinced clients that our software will solve issues they had often given up on. 

I decided to learn to code after my long suffering developer colleagues got fed up with me asking them non stop questions about how our software had all it’s functionality. 
I started learning to Ruby in my free time in Winter 2018 after completing a five week course with Google Digital garage that introduced me to Javascript and CSS. In January 2020, I became a full time developer learning Full Stack web development, ReatcJS, Javascript and CSS. 

When I am not working on my personal projects, I can be found around London attending tech Meetup groups and conferences; 
Ruby Hacknight London,
ReactJs Girls, 
CodeBar  London, 
IBM Code London.
Code Mesh 

My motivation for coding is to one day be able to solve most of the world’s issues through code.</h2>
